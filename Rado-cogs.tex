\section{Rado graph, with cogs}
In this section we work with the following setting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    $\mathcal{L}_0$ is a (possibly infinite) relational language;

    \item 
    $\mathcal{C}_0$ is a monotone, free amalgamation class of $\mathcal{L}_0$-structures 
    where each $R \in \mathcal{L}_0$ is interpreted irreflexively;

    \item 
    $\mathcal{L}$ consists of $\mathcal{L}_0$ together with a new binary symbol $<$;

    \item 
    $\mathcal{C}$ consists of $\mathcal{L}$-structures obtained from $\mathcal{C}_0$ by expanding with all possible linear orderings;

    \item 
    $\A_0$ and $\A$ are the respective Fraïssé limits of $\mathcal{C}_0$ and $\mathcal{C}$;

    \item 
    and $O$ is an $S$-orbit in $\A^k_<$, where $S \subseteq \A$ is finite.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{cog} in $O$ consists of atoms
    \[
        a_1 < b_1 < a_2 < b_2 < \cdots < a_d < b_d
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    ``Cogs arise everywhere''
\end{proposition}
