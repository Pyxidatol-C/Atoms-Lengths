\subsection{Duals}
It was shown in \cite[Example~6.9]{BFKM24} that orbit-finitely generated vector spaces over the Rado graph are not closed under duals over the two-element field.
We can lift the assumption on the field, and we will extend this result to the $K_n$-free Henson graphs.
\begin{theorem}
    Assume $\A$ is the Rado graph or the $K_n$-free Henson graph.
    Then \[
        \fsfun \A \field
    \] is not orbit-finitely generated for any $\field$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By Theorem~\ref{thm:ordered-free-amalg-has-finite-length}, 
    if the space of finitely supported functions from $\A$ to $\field$ is orbit-finitely generated, then it would have finite length.
    However, we will exhibit an infinite ascending chain of equivariant subspaces.

    We can find anti-cliques $I_0, I_1, I_2, \dots$ of sizes $0, 1, 2, \dots$ inside $\A$.
    Let $f_n : \A \to \{0, 1\} \subseteq \field$ be the characteristic function for the common neighbours of all vertices in $I_n$. 
    (Of course, each $f_n$ is supported by $I_n$.)
    We claim that
    \[
        \langle f_0 \rangle 
        \subset \langle f_0, f_1 \rangle
        \subset \langle f_0, f_1, f_2 \rangle
        \subset \cdots
    \]
    is strictly increasing.
    To see this, suppose otherwise that
    \[
        f_{n+1} = \sum_{I \in \mathbb{I}} \lambda_I \cdot f_I
    \]
    where every $I \in \mathbb{I}$ is an anti-clique on at most $n$ vertices, whose common neighbours have characteristic function $f_I$.

    \begin{claim}
        $\lambda_I = 0$ for all $I \in \mathbb{I}$.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose that $\lambda_I = 0$ whenever $|I| < d$. (The base case $d = 0$ is vacuous.)
        Take $I \in \mathbb{I}$ with $|I| = d$.
        Writing $\mathbb{J} = \{J \in \mathbb{I} \setminus \{I\} \mid |J| \geq d\}$, 
        we have
        \[
            f_{n+1} = \lambda_I \cdot f_I 
            + \sum_{J \in \mathbb{J}} \lambda_J \cdot f_J.
        \]
        We may pick a vertex $a \in \A$ that is adjacent to all of $I$ but to none of $\bigcup_{J \in \mathbb{J}} J \cup I_{n+1} \setminus I$.
        Then $f_I(a) = 1$. 
        On the other hand, since $I$ cannot contain $I_{n+1}$ or any $J \in \mathbb{J}$, we must have $f_{n+1}(a) = 0 = f_J(a)$.
        Evaluating the equation above at $a$ yields
        \[
            0 = \lambda_I \cdot 1 + \sum_{J \in \mathbb{J}} \lambda_J \cdot 0;
        \]
        that is, we conclude $\lambda_I = 0$ for any $I \in \mathbb{I}$ with $|I| = d$.
    \end{proof}

    So $f_{n+1}$ is the constant zero function, which is impossible:
    in $\A$ we can certainly find some vertex adjacent to all of $I_{n+1}$.
    This shows that 
    \[
        \fsfun \A \field
    \]
    fails to be Noetherian,
    so it cannot have finite length or be orbit-finitely generated. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Unambiguous automata}
Consider the Rado graph or the $K_n$-free Henson graph.
The language
\[
    \text{``the last letter (exists and) is adjacent to every previous letter''}
\]
is recognised by the unambiguous automaton with guessing below.
\[\begin{tikzpicture}[->, every state/.style={minimum size=8mm}, initial text=,]
  % states
  \node[state, initial]            (a) {$a$};
  \node[state, initial, below=of a] (b) {$b$};
  \node[below=of b] (etc) {$\vdots$};
  \node[state, accepting, right=2cm of etc] (q) {};

  % loops (user requested the label exactly "x : E(x, a)" on each)
  \draw (a) edge[loop above] node{$x : E(x, a)$} (a);
  \draw (b) edge[loop above]  node{$x : E(x, b)$} (b);

  % transitions from each initial state to the accepting state
  \draw (a) edge[bend left] node[above right]{$a$} (q);
  \draw (b) edge[bend left] node[above right]{$b$} (q);
\end{tikzpicture}\]
We show that it cannot be recognised by a weighted automaton with outputs in $\{0, 1\}$.

Consider the derivative ${w-} : \A^* \to \{0, 1\} \subseteq \field$ given a word $w \in \A^*$,
where $w v a = 1$ precisely when $a$ is adjacent to every atom appearing in $w v$.
We claim that
\[
    \langle - \rangle \subset 
    \langle -, {a_1-} \mid a_1 \in \A \rangle \subset
    \langle -, {a_1-}, {a_1 a_2-} \mid a_1, a_2 \in \A \rangle \subset
    \cdots
\]
is strictly increasing. 
Suppose to the contrary that for distinct atoms $a_1, \dots, a_m \in \A$, we can write
\[
    {a_1 \dots a_m -} = \sum_i \lambda_i \cdot {w_i -}
\]
where each $w_i$ contains $m_i < m$ distinct atoms.
\begin{claim}
    $\lambda_i = 0$ whenever $m_i < d = 0, 1, \dots, m$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    Pick any $i$ with $m_i = d$. 
    If $\A$ is the $K_n$-free Henson graph and $w_i$ contains an clique on $n$ vertices, then ${w_i -}$ is the constant zero function --- so we may well remove it from the sum.
    So we may find an atom $x$ which is adjacent to all atoms in $w_i$ but to no other atom in $a_1 \dots a_m$ and the $w_j$'s.
    Then
    \[
        0 = a_1 \dots a_m x = \sum_{j} \lambda_j \cdot w_j x = \sum_{j : m_j < m_i} 0 + \lambda_i \cdot 1 + \sum_{j \neq i : m_j \geq m_i} 0.
    \]
    Indeed, we have $w_j x = 0$ if $m_j < m_i = d$ by the inductive hypothesis. 
    Now $a_1 \dots a_m x = 0 = w_j x$ for the other $j$'s,
    since $a_1 \dots a_m$ and $w_j$ must contain some atom outside those appearing in $w_i$, which by construction is not a neighbour of $x$.
\end{proof}

So $\langle {w-} \mid w \in \A^* \rangle$ is not orbit-finitely spanned, which by a Myhill--Nerode argument means that the language $\varepsilon -$ cannot be recognised by a weighted automaton \cite[Theorem~7.3]{BFKM24}.
It follows that weighted automata are strictly weaker than a non-deterministic model which stipulates only that ``there are finitely many runs with non-zero weights.''
Also, the reversal of the language clearly can be recognised by a deterministic automaton 
--- so languages over the Rado or Henson graphs recognised by weighted automata fail to be closed under reversal.
