A structure 𝔸:
- is _oligomorphic_ if $\text{ 𝔸}^d$ has finitely many orbits under the automorphism group of 𝔸 for $d = 1, 2, \dots$;
- is _finitely homogeneous_ if it is a first-order reduct of a homogeneous structure in a finite relational vocabulary.
- has the _ascending chain property (ACP)_ if $\text{Lin}_F\text{ 𝔸}^d$ is Noetherian for $d = 1, 2, \dots$ over any field $F$;
- has the _finite length property (FLP)_ if $\text{Lin}_F\text{ 𝔸}^d$ has finite length for $d = 1, 2, \dots$ over any field $F$;
- has _FLP/fin_ (resp., _FLP/0_) if it has the finite length property over all finite fields (resp., fields of characteristic 0).

**Conjectures:**
1. oligomorphic => ACP

2. finitely homogeneous (blurred in figure above) => FLP

3. oligomorphic => FLP/0

Conjecture 1 was raised [by Evans and Camina in 1991](https://doi.org/10.1093/qmath/42.1.15) and [by Bojańczyk et al. in 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02438).
Positive answers can be obtained by providing [Ahlbrandt–Ziegler enumerations](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-0072(86)90037-0) for $\text{ 𝔸}^d$ or by showing 𝔸 is [ω-well-structured (Ghosh and Lasota'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17604).

Conjecture 2 can — through the manipulation of _cogs_ — be confirmed for free amalgamation classes, in a binary vocabulary, expanded with a generic total order.
David Evans pointed out in 2025 that a failure of "finitely homogeneous => FLP/fin" would refute Simon Thomas's conjecture on first-order reducts. 
Using a Ramsey-theoretic technique, he also proved $\text{Lin}_F\text{ 𝔸}^2$ has finite length without our arity assumption. 
(To show cogs span balanced vectors, he shows a finitely supported cog-killer kills balanced vectors.) 

Conjecture 3 appears to be new. 
We have positive results for a generalisation of smoothly approximated structures: 
by using Maschke's Theorem, we can bound the length of chains by the number of orbits.
In particular, we establish FLP/0 for some structures that are not finitely homogeneous and indeed do not have FLP/fin.

Below is a selection of concrete structures and the length-scape.
