We apply smooth approximations to confirm the CSP dichotomy conjecture for first-order reducts of the random tournament and to give new short proofs of the conjecture for various homogeneous graphs including the random graph (STOC’11, ICALP’16, JACM 2015, SICOMP 2019), and for expansions of the order of the rationals (STOC’08, JACM 2009). Apart from obtaining these dichotomy results, we show how our new proof technique allows one to unify and significantly simplify the previous results from the literature. For all but the last structure, we moreover characterize for the first time those CSPs that are solvable by local consistency methods, again using the same machinery.},

Tools exist to reduce many questions about arbitrary finite groups to similar questions about simple groups. Since the classification there have been numerous applications of this theory in other branches of mathematics. Finite Group Theory develops the foundations of the theory of finite groups. It can serve as a text for a course on finite groups for students already exposed to a first course in algebra. It could supply the background necessary to begin reading journal articles in the field. For specialists it also provides a reference on the foundations of the subject. This second edition has been considerably improved with a completely rewritten Chapter 15 considering the 2-Signalizer Functor Theorem, and the addition of an appendix containing solutions to exercises.},

abstract = {We study orbit-finite systems of linear equations, in the setting of sets with atoms. Our principal contribution is a decision procedure for solvability of such systems. The procedure works for every field (and even commutative ring) under mild effectiveness assumptions, and reduces a given orbit-finite system to a number of finite ones: exponentially many in general, but polynomially many when the atom dimension of input systems is fixed. Towards obtaining the procedure we push further the theory of vector spaces generated by orbit-finite sets, and show that each such vector space admits an orbit-finite basis. This fundamental property is a key tool in our development, but should be also of wider interest.},
