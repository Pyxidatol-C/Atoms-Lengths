\section{Conclusions}
With Theorems~\ref{thm:weak-smooth-approximation-finite-length} and \ref{thm:ordered-free-amalg-has-finite-length} and their corollaries, we have extended the finite length property far beyond equality and ordered atoms, the two examples considered in~\cite{BFKM24}. We have used two approaches, one based on cogs, and one without them.

% Another recipe for producing more structures from $\A$ is by considering $(\A, {=}c_1, \dots, {=}c_k)$, where $c_1, \dots, c_k \in \A$ are seen as constants.
% Because $\A^{d+k}$ is orbit-finite for every $d$,
% this expansion is again oligomorphic if $\A$ is so. But we do not know whether the finite length property of the expansion can be deduced from the property for $\A$ in general. We only know a few positive examples:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item 
%     Expansions of $(\N, =)$ or $(\Q, \leq)$ by finitely many constants are interpretable in the original structure~\cite[Lem~2.22]{BodirskyBodorMarimon_25},
%     so they have the finite length property by Theorem~\ref{thm:ordered-free-amalg-has-finite-length} in light of 
%     Lemma~\ref{lem:interpretations-preserve-fin-len}. (See also~\cite[Thm.~4.10]{BFKM24}.)
%     \item 
%     On the other hand, for $\A$ the Rado graph, it was shown in \cite{no-constant-interpreted-in-Rado} that $(\A, {=}c)$ does not interpret in $\A$ for any $c \in \A$. 
%     Instead, we explicitly took the constant into account when we established the finite length property in Corollary~\ref{cor:free-finite-length}.
% \end{itemize}

 In the cog-based approach of Sections~\ref{sec:free-amalg}--\ref{sec:equivariant-subspaces}, we cover the generically ordered Fraïssé limit of any free amalgamation class over a finite relational vocabulary of relational symbols of arity at most $2$. We do not know how to drop the arity restriction from our proofs, so it is interesting that recently, using a different approach, Evans proved~\cite[Prop.~3.10]{Evans_pm1} that $\Lin \A^2$ has finite length for certain structures with  vocabularies of arbitrarily high arity. We do not know how to combine these results. 
Our main cog-based result is Theorem~\ref{thm:cog-span-generally}, 
which allows us to describe all equivariant subspaces in any orbit-finite-dimensional vector space, and to deduce the finite length property with a tight bound.
However, as we saw in Section~\ref{sec:duals}, these structures can give rise to ill-behaved models of computation:
over the Rado and Henson graphs, orbit-finitely spanned sets do not admit orbit-finitely spanned function spaces, and weighted register automata are not closed under reversal.

The cog-less approach to oligomorphically approximated structures in Section~\ref{sec:characteristic-zero} is almost complementary.
The finite length property is proved there only over fields of characteristic $0$; indeed some structures covered in that setting, notably vector atoms (Ex.~\ref{ex:vector-space-atoms}), do not have the finite length property over finite fields~\cite[Sec.~4.4]{BFKM24}.
But the proof here is quick and elegant, and covers two important subclasses of oligomorphic structures. 
The first is $\omega$-stable structures, which admit orbit-finitely spanned dual spaces according to~\cite[Thm.~3.7]{Przybylek_2024}.
The second is weakly Lie coordinatisable structures, which are thoroughly studied in \cite{CherlinHrushovski_03} and provide a rich variety of examples.

We finish the paper by reiterating some open questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite[Q.~2]{CaminaEvans_91} Does every oligomorphic structure have the ascending chain property? 
\item ~\cite[Q.~1.4]{Evans_pm1} Does every structure homogeneous over a finite vocabulary have the finite length property?
\end{itemize}

We also  ask a new one: Does every oligomorphic structure have the finite length property over fields of characteristic $0$?

We do not even know the answer to these questions for some concrete and well-studied Fraïssé limits, notably the universal partial order or the countable atomless Boolean algebra.
